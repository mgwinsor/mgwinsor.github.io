Welcome to my personal website! This is where you'll find my thoughts on tech
and some of the projects I have worked on. I mostly write Python (it pays the
bills for now), but I'm slowly finding more ways to use Go.

I'm now working as a software engineer in Singapore. I previously worked as a data engineer,
but got tired of building pipelines and all the data quality issues (and lack
of software engineering principles in that "discipline").

Now I focus on _attempting_ to build CLIs and websites (with Go, of course).
I'm also starting to look into building on the Sui blockchain, but that journey
is just beginning.


And oh yeah, almost forgot! I use NeoVim, btw ;)
