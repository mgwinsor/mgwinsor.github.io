Some time ago, when ChatGPT was still quite new, I asked it to write a poem
about vim. The prompt was as follows:
> Can you also write me a poem about vim in the style of Shakespeare?

The result was amusing enough for me to share it here. Hope you enjoy.

> Of Vim, that editor of text so great, \
> I'll sing a song of high estate. \
> With keystrokes deft and motions quick, \
> It doth make all our coding slick.
> 
> In Vim, we doth create and edit, \
> Code that's worthy of great credit. \
> Commands that work with vim-like ease, \
> Doth help us code with utmost peace.
> 
> With Vim, we doth insert and delete, \
> Whole lines of code with nary a beat. \
> We navigate, we jump and hop, \
> With Vim we doth never stop.
> 
> The motions that we make in Vim, \
> Doth make our coding path quite trim. \
> With shortcuts that we know so well, \
> Our coding doth the fastest swell.
> 
> So let us praise this editor great, \
> That makes our coding truly first-rate. \
> With Vim we doth have all we need, \
> To write code with utmost speed.
