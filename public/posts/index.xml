      <description>Some time ago, when ChatGPT was still quite new, I asked it to write a poem about vim. The prompt was as follows:&#xA;Can you also write me a poem about vim in the style of Shakespeare?&#xA;The result was amusing enough for me to share it here. Hope you enjoy.&#xA;Of Vim, that editor of text so great, I&amp;rsquo;ll sing a song of high estate. With keystrokes deft and motions quick, It doth make all our coding slick.</description>
